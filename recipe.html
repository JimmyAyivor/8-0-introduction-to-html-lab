<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Combine salt, granulated garlic, cumin, paprika, coriander, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper in a small bowl.
    </li>
    <li>Pat chicken thighs dry with paper towels. Sprinkle seasoning mix evenly over both sides of chicken thighs.
    </li>
    <li>Combine butter and olive oil in a deep-sided, 11-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat; cook until butter
        is melted and foamy. Swirl the butter and oil together and place chicken thighs in the skillet in a single
        layer. Cook until just brown, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove from the pan with tongs and set aside. Keep warm.
    </li>
    <li>Reduce heat to medium and add onion and bell peppers to the skillet. Cook, stirring often, until the onion
        starts to turn translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in rice and chili powder; cook and stir until rice begins to
        pick up some color, 3 to 5 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>Stir in drained tomatoes and garlic; cook and stir for 1 minute. Add reserved tomato liquid, chicken broth, and
        water; bring to a boil. Adjust salt and pepper if necessary.
    </li>
    <li>Place browned chicken thighs on top of the rice mixture; do not submerge. Cover, reduce heat to low, and cook
        for 20 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>Remove cover, increase heat to medium, and gently stir in thawed peas. Cook until chicken is no longer pink in
        the center and the juices run clear, about 5 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center
        should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Serve warm.</li>
